QXmpp is a cross-platform C++ XMPP client library based on the Qt
framework. It tries to use Qt's programming conventions in order to ease
the learning curve for new programmers.

QXmpp based clients are built using QXmppClient instances which handle the
establishment of the XMPP connection and provide a number of high-level
"managers" to perform specific tasks. You can write your own managers to
extend QXmpp by subclassing QXmppClientExtension.
